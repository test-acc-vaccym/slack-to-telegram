`slack-to-telegram` is a simple way to forward notifications from Slack to Telegram when you are not logged into Slack. It uses Slack's [Real Time Messaging API](https://api.slack.com/rtm) to connect to specified accounts and will forward messages through Telegram's [Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) to you.

## Why 
I currently run CopperheadOS (https://copperhead.co/android/) on my phone, which does not include any Google apps and services. Slack for Android requires Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) in order to receive notifications. Since Telegram has it's own mechanism for notifications on Android that does not rely on GCM, I decided to use this as a workaround to receive timely Slack notications.

## Features
* Support for multiple Slack workspaces
* Get notifications for direct messages and @username callouts in channels

## One Time Initial Setup
* From the Telegram account you want to receive messages on, get your user ID by sending a message to `@get_id_bot`
* Create a telegram bot (https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot) and get the token
* Send a test message from your Telegram account to your bots username
* For each Slack account you want to forward messages, sign into Slack and then go to https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens and generate a token

## Config File
Create a file named config.toml and fill in the details from initial setup above.

    [telegram]
    user = 123456789 
    token = "323456789:ABCDE_fB19OHQZUF3FPPPF43PTEEB"

    [[slack]]
    name = "workspace #1"
    token = "xoxp-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

    [[slack]]
    name = "workspace #2"
    token = "xoxp-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
